Done:
- Modify Winning Screen to show Option of Playing again (restart).
- Compile Js files into one file. + remove Js type=module from html. (I used defer to allow script to pre-load)

Not Done:

- Fix some console.log outputs.
- Modify README.md file and explain how to make python server to run the game (using cmd : python3 -m http.server) instead of using Live Server. 


In progress:
- Add Level Counter to main screen - not linked in js yet.
